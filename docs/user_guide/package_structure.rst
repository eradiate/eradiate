Main entry points
-----------------

Core support [:mod:`eradiate`]
    The top-level module contains basic support functions required to do almost
    anything with Eradiate.

Scene generation [:mod:`eradiate.scenes`]
    This package exposes the scene generation components. It includes convenient
    interfaces to create objects representing the geometry, optical properties,
    illumination and measures in the scene on which you'll run your radiative
    transfer simulation.

Experiments [:mod:`eradiate.experiments`]
    In this package, you will find interfaces to trigger simulation runs,
    including pre- and post-processing operations.

Command-line interface [:mod:`eradiate.cli`]
    This package contains the implementation of the Eradiate command-line
    interface.

Radiometric kernel
------------------

Kernel [:mod:`eradiate.kernel`]
    This module provides functionality related with Eradiate's radiometric
    kernel Mitsuba.

Data handling and visualization
-------------------------------

Data handling [:mod:`eradiate.data`]
    This package serves data shipped with Eradiate.

Post-processing pipeline definitions [:mod:`eradiate.pipelines`]
    This package provides a post-processing pipeline framework used to convert
    raw sensor results yielded by kernel sensors to quantities of interest for
    Earth observation applications (*e.g.* reflectance). The data is stored as
    xarray labelled arrays (:term:`Dataset`).

Plotting [:mod:`eradiate.plot`]
    This module defines optional utility functions to create
    `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_-based visualisations of Eradiate's
    input and output data.

Physical properties
-------------------

Radiative properties [:mod:`eradiate.radprops`]
    This package provides abstractions used to define radiative properties used
    to create scenes.

Other support components
------------------------

Numerical constants [:mod:`eradiate.constants`]
    Various numerical constants used throughout the code base.

Class writing facilities [``eradiate.{`` :mod:`~eradiate.attrs`, :mod:`~eradiate.converters`, :mod:`~eradiate.validators`, :mod:`~eradiate._factory` ``}``]
    These components are part of Eradiate's core class writing system. It relies
    on the `attrs <https://www.attrs.org>`_ library, extended for `Pint <https://pint.readthedocs.io>`_
    compatibility by the `Pinttrs <https://pinttrs.readthedocs.io>`_ library.

Exceptions [:mod:`eradiate.exceptions`]
    Exception and warning definitions.

Math support [``eradiate.{`` :mod:`~eradiate.frame`, :mod:`~eradiate.quad`, :mod:`~eradiate.warp` ``}``]
    For the cases where Eradiate's math dependencies and kernel are not
    enough, additional mathematical tools are provided.

Random number generation [:mod:`eradiate.rng`]
    Support components for fine control of random number generation.

Unit support [:mod:`eradiate.units`]
    Various utility functions and data variables used to safely handle unit
    conversions in Eradiate.

xarray utility functions [:mod:`eradiate.xarray`]
    Various support components taking advantage of the xarray library.

Miscellaneous [:mod:`eradiate.util`]
    Other support components which don't fit in any of the aforementioned
    classification entries.
