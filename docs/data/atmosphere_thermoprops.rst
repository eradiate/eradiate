Atmosphere: Thermophysical properties
=====================================

An atmospheric thermophysical property dataset provides the spatial variation
of air pressure, air temperature, air number density, and air constituents'
mole fractions.

The `Joseki <https://github.com/rayference/joseki>`__ software package provides
components to generate standard profiles, and rescale, resample and transform
existing profiles. Users can use their own data provided that they comply with
the Joseki data format.
See the `Joseki documentation <https://joseki.readthedocs.io/>`__ for details.
