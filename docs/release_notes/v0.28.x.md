# v0.28.x series

## v0.28.0 (9th August 2024)

In this major release, we added a new variant of the volumetric path tracing
algorithm that performs much better when working with a plane-parallel
atmosphere. We also added an option to report an estimate of the variance on
the main radiometric variable computed by each sensor. We also improved the
documentation of our spectral response function library, and performed some
cleanup on the data we provide.

```{warning}
When upgrading, pay attention to the following:

* We removed the PRISMA band SRFs, which were effectively computed from Gaussian
  parameters. Instead, users should use the {func}`.srf_tools.make_gaussian`
  function.
* We capped our Numpy version requirement to prevent unintentional upgrade to
  v2.0.0+. While this is a questionable choice, we had to make this decision
  because we cannot currently guarantee that our code will be compatible with
  all supported Numpy version. We will relax this constraint as soon as
  possible.
```

### Removed

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Removed the SRFs for the PRISMA instrument from the data repository
  ({ghpr}`430`). {func}`.srf_tools.make_gaussian` serves as a replacement.

### Added

* Added a new integral-based SRF filtering algorithm that enforces spectral
  domain coverage with respect to the SRF's mean value ({ghpr}`420`).
* Added an SRF filter that pads an SRF dataset with leading and trailing zeros
  ({ghpr}`420`).
* Added piecewise medium and integrator ({ghpr}`421`).
* üñ•Ô∏è Added benchmarking infrastructure and cases ({ghpr}`423`).
* Added moment integrator and radiance variance output ({ghpr}`426`).
* üìñ Overhauled SRF data documentation, which now contains a database index
  ({ghpr}`430`).
* üìñ Added documentation for data docs editing ({ghpr}`430`).
* Added an experimental validation schema for the SRF dataset format
  ({ghpr}`430`).

### Changed

* SRF data for AQUA and TERRA MODIS, NPP/JPSS VIIRS, Metop AVHRR and Metimage,
  MTG FCI and LI, PROBA-V, and Sentinel-2A/B MSI are updated with automated
  pre-processing ({ghpr}`430`).
* üìñ Improved data documentation rendering ({ghpr}`430`).
* üñ•Ô∏è Updated Mitsuba submodule to v0.2.4.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Capped Numpy requirement to <2.0.0 until we fully test Eradiate with Numpy
  v2.

### Fixed

* Fallback for unimplemented spectral quadrature specifications is now correctly
  behaved: if no value for the maximum number of *g*-points is supplied, a
  consistent default is used ({ghpr}`419`).
* Fixed incorrect type checks performed upon initialization of all
  {class}`.EarthObservationExperiment` child classes and in post-processing
  pipeline logic ({ghpr}`422`).
* Fixed out-of-bounds indexing in the SRF filtering tool ({ghpr}`429`).

### Internal changes

* üñ•Ô∏è Switched to Mamba for Conda lock file generation ({ghpr}`425`).
* üñ•Ô∏è Switched to uv for Pip lock file generation ({ghpr}`425`).
