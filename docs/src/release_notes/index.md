# Release notes

```{note}
For now, Eradiate uses a [ZeroVer](https://0ver.org) versioning
scheme. It reflects the relative instability of our API: breaking changes may
happen at any time. We plan to switch to a versioning scheme more similar to
SemVer in the future.

Updates are tracked in this change log. Every time you decide to update to a
newer version, we recommend that you to go through the list of changes.
We try hard to remain backward-compatible and warn in advance for deprecation
when necessary‚Äîwe also advise to not ignore `DeprecationWarning`s.

Emoji marks have the following meaning:

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires particular attention during upgrade or usage
  (breaking change or experimental feature).
* üìñ Documentation-related change.
* üñ•Ô∏è This is a developer-facing change.
