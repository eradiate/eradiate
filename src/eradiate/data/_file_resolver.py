class FileResolver:
    """
    This class resolves paths relative to a list of locations on disk.
    Locations are looked up in order upon calling the :meth:`.resolve` method.
    If a lookup is successful, the resolved absolute path is returned;
    otherwise, the input path is returned unchanged.

    Parameters
    ----------
    paths : list of path-likes, optional
        A list of search directories. Each entry must exist.

    Notes
    -----
    * By default, the unique file resolver instance
      :data:`eradiate.fresolver <.fresolver>` is initialized with the
      installation path of the asset manager (see :class:`.AssetManager`) and,
      when in dev mode (see :data:`SOURCE_DIR <eradiate.config.SOURCE_DIR>`),
      the path to the location of test files.
    * The current working directory is not appended to the file resolver by
      default. It can however optionally be added temporarily when calling
      :meth:`resolve` (and wrappers such as :meth:`load_dataset`). This is
      useful when using the ``strict`` mode, which raises if the requested path
      cannot be resolved to an existing file.


    Examples
    --------
    A single instance of the file resolver is available as
    :data:`eradiate.fresolver <.fresolver>`:

    >>> from eradiate import fresolver
    >>> fresolver.resolve("srf/sentinel_2a-msi-3.nc")
    >>> fresolver.load_dataset("srf/sentinel_2a-msi-3.nc")
