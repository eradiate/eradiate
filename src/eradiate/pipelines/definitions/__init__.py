"""
This module contains definitions for all post-processing pipeline operations.
The implementation complies with the `Hamilton <https://hamilton.dagworks.io/>`_
dataflow framework's specifications: the post-processing pipeline is modelled as
a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and all post-processing operations are a node in
that DAG.

Eradiate uses advanced Hamilton features to mutate the pipeline based on
configuration input. For example:

* Node names reflect the processed physical quantity.
* Viewing angles are only computed if the measure is distant.
* Post-processing operations vary depending on the active mode. For example,
  SRF weighted averaging is only performed in CKD modes.

New pipelines can be created by adding new definition modules to this package.

For clarity, the implementation is split as follows:

* :mod:`eradiate.pipelines.logic` provides the fundamental logic powering each
  step of post-processing;
* :mod:`eradiate.pipelines.definitions` contains the pipeline definition and is
  intended to be consumed by the Hamilton driver constructor for pipeline
  initialization;
* :mod:`eradiate.pipelines.core` provides convenience entry points to facilitate
  post-processing pipeline initialization.
